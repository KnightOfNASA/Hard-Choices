# Background
"Hard Choices", published under "Hillary Clinton", was ghostwritten by Ted Widmer, a professor at Brown Univerisity, Dan Schwerin, and Ethan Gelber. Thus, a question arises on whether or not the ghostwriters' gender, being all male, writing under the guise of a woman, affected the perception of the content of the book. While writing subjects with different genders than the author has been a stable in writing, study has shown that writing style is hard to disguise (unless you are someone like James Joyce). Thus, a man writing under the perspective of a woman will retain the male way of speech in some way. 

While its doubtful that the book was widely read or being used in any academic manner in so much to influence the perspection of the subject, it's still of vast interest to analysis the effect of gender on the content of the book. The research will certainly be trivial compared to the far greater field of gender linguistic research, thus this is merely a hobby project and the data from this project should not be taken too seriously. 

# Other Information
This is a sister project to analysis of another book published under Hillary's name, "What Happened". Information about that project can be found at https://github.com/KnightOfNASA/What-Happened.
